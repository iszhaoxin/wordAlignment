\section{Introduction}
	awesome introduction.

		\item[Approach]{Learn importance weights for each vectors to mitigate the noise.}
	\end{itemize}

	Word align is important task.

	We focus on unsupervised setting.


	Previous work gives importance weight for each vectors
		using hieistics technique such as frequency.
	For example, work xxx...


	However, such methods are just hieistics

	we propose new method to adjust the importance weight.

	we conduct following experiments to support out approach is effective.
