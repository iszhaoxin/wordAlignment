\section{Related Work}
	awesome related work!

	We need introduce previous work related to unsupervised word alignment in order.

	\subsection{Unsupervised Word Alignment}
		blah blah

	\subsection{Importance weights in Previous work}
		We need to 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[1] List up approaches how previous work set importance weights for word embeddings.
			\item[2] Categprize previous work by the approaches.
			\item[3] Locate our approach in the categorization.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Noisyness in Word Alignment}
		Noisy embedidngs play key role in our paper.
		We need to explain how previous work paid attention to this point, i.e., mitigate the noisyness.
